Train data set error -
Dev data set error - 

if the NN did not work well on the train data set - high bias (under fitting)
if the NN did not work well on the dev data set - high variance (overfitting)

to improve bias -> deeper neural network (more layers)
to improve variance -> more data set 
to improve variance -> regularization (comes with a tradeoff on the bias though).

improve bias -> more hidden layers
                longer train (Epoch)
                advance optimization algorithms*
                NN architecture
once bias is reduced 
improve variance -> more data 
                    regularization
                    NN architecture
